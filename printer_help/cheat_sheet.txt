#How to do distortion correction
0) Always disable auto correction, just use distortion only
1) Disable distortion correction (M323 S0 P1, Set EEPROM: Z max length: 168.0 & Z-probe height: 0.0)
2) Heat bed and nozzle
3) Find the delta of the z probe and the nozzle
4) Stick that value in EEPROM for Z-probe height
5) Home
6) Make sure the values in Configuration.h are correct for where it will test the bed
7) Remember G33 does not take into account G92
8) Best thing to do is to just never use G92 ever
9) Also G33 does not take into account Z-probe offset 
10) Run distortion correction using G33
11) Enable it and home it (M323 S1 P1)
12) Test that it's working
